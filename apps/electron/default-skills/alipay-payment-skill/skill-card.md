This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Publisher: <br>
[alipay](https://clawhub.ai/user/alipay) <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
MIT-0 <br>


## Use Case: <br>
Developers and agents use this skill to route Alipay-related payment events, run required alipay-bot or curl steps, and return payment status, product information, or feedback guidance. Wallet authorization and wallet opening are delegated to the companion alipay-authenticate-wallet skill. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: The skill can initiate Alipay payment flows, and the security summary notes broad payment authority without a clear final approval before some payment submission steps. <br>
Mitigation: Require fresh explicit user approval immediately before submit-payment or 402-buyer-pay, and stop rather than proceed when approval is ambiguous. <br>
Risk: Payment workflows may involve sensitive request headers or credentials. <br>
Mitigation: Do not replay Authorization, Cookie, API key, or other secret-bearing headers unless they are verified as necessary and safe. <br>
Risk: The skill depends on the third-party Alipay CLI package. <br>
Mitigation: Install only when the publisher and package are trusted, and use the declared package and integrity metadata from the release evidence. <br>
